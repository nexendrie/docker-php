Nexendrie PHP image
===================

This is our PHP docker image which we use in GitLab CI. It is based on dockette/php but we provide version 7.1 only (as it is the only version of PHP supported by our packages).

It runs on Debian Jessie and contains a good number of PHP extensions, as well as Composer and phing.
